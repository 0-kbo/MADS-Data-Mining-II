    "## Question 1: Load the dataset (10 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the first step towards imitating Shakespeare's writing, you will create a function called `load_data` that loads his original *Sonnets* from `assets/gutenberg/THE_SONNETS.txt`. This function should accomplish the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extract sentences from the data file.** Of course, depending on the nature of the task at hand, what constitutes a *sentence* can vary. In the context of this assignment, we will define a sentence as just a line of a sonnet, regardless of the punctuation at end. In addition, we will ignore the boundaries of the sonnets --- that is, we are not dealing with $154$ individual *sonnets* but rather $154 \\times 14 = 2156$ *sentences* (actually only $2155$ sentences, as *Sonnet 99* has [15 lines](https://www.google.com/search?ei=po4hX9jzN4rKtQaL7K-wDg&q=why+is+sonnet+99+15+lines&oq=why+is+sonnet+99+15+lines&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECAAQR1ChGlihGmCqHGgAcAJ4AIABXIgBXJIBATGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjY3snX3PLqAhUKZc0KHQv2C-YQ4dUDCAw&uact=5) but *Sonnet 126* has only [12](https://www.google.com/search?ei=d4whX6_uH9a4tQbUiISoDA&q=why+is+sonnet+126+only+12+lines&oq=o+thou+my+lovely+boy+who+in+thy+power&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQARgBMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHUABYAGCWEWgAcAJ4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAKoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=psy-ab)). We encourage you to explore alternative definitions of a sentence on your own; for example, an entire sonnet could be modelled as a sentence. Finally, make sure that the newline character `\\n` at the end of each line is dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenise each extracted sentence.** While it's ambiguous what a sentence is, what constitutes a \"*word*\" is even more task-dependent. Do punctuations count as \"words\"? Are two \"words\" with the same spelling but different casing considered identical? Since what a text file contains is nothing more than a squence of characters, there are many possible ways of grouping these characters to form \"words\" that are subsequently taken as input by a program. To distinguish what's actually taken as input by a program from a linguistic word, we call the former a *token*. The process of producing a list of tokens out of a sentence is then called *tokenisation*. At this step, you will first lower-case each sentence extracted from the previous step entirely and then tokenise each lower-cased sentence. You may use any tokeniser of your choice, such as `word_tokenize` from the `nltk` library. The grading of the assignment doesn't depend on your choice of the tokeniser. \n",

    "**This function should return a `list` of length 2155, where each element is a `list` of `str` representing the tokens of each sentence as produced by the tokeniser of your choice. An example output would be:**\n",
